## CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. In the Airbnb Clone project, CI/CD ensures that new changes are reliably integrated, tested, and deployed with minimal manual intervention. This leads to faster development cycles, fewer bugs, and consistent deployment practices.

CI/CD pipelines help:

Automatically run tests on every code push to catch issues early.

Build and package the application in a reproducible environment using Docker.

Deploy updates to staging or production environments with confidence and consistency.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
GitHub Actions: Automates tasks like running tests, linting code, and deploying services based on GitHub events (e.g., push, pull request).

Docker: Ensures consistent application environments across development, testing, and production.

Docker Compose: Used to define and manage multi-container applications (e.g., app + PostgreSQL + Redis).

(Optional): Integration with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Heroku) for automatic deployment.
