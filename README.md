ðŸ§© Feature Breakdown
The Airbnb Clone project is built to simulate key functionalities of a real-world property rental platform. Below is a breakdown of the main features included in the backend system:

1. User Management
Handles user registration, login, and profile updates. It ensures secure authentication and distinguishes between hosts and guests to support different roles and actions within the system.

2. Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, view, and delete property listings. This feature supports detailed property descriptions, locations, and availability settings, forming the foundation for user interaction with listings.

3. Booking System
Enables guests to book available properties for specific date ranges. It includes check-in/check-out details and prevents double bookings by managing date conflicts.

4. Payment Processing
Integrates a payment mechanism to handle transactions tied to bookings. This feature tracks payment status and ensures that all bookings are financially secured before confirmation.

5. Review System
Lets users leave reviews and ratings for properties after their stay. This encourages transparency and helps future guests make informed decisions based on previous experiences.

6. API Access (REST & GraphQL)
Supports both RESTful and GraphQL APIs for flexible and efficient client-side integration. This ensures compatibility with a wide range of frontend frameworks and third-party services.

7. Performance Optimization
Includes indexing, caching, and asynchronous task handling to improve system responsiveness. These optimizations ensure that the platform remains scalable and efficient under high load.
